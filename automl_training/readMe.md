This folder contains all the labelled data for training that Vivian gathered.

She used several datasets:
    - [Missouri Cameratraps](http://lila.science/datasets/missouricameratraps)
    - [Caltech Cameratraps](https://beerys.github.io/CaltechCameraTraps/)
    - [Openimages Database](https://storage.googleapis.com/openimages/web/index.html)
    - deer\_cxl, which contains all the pictures that Will/Mia gathered.
        - unclear where they're actually gathered from

The scripts floating around in this directory and the subdirectories were to help with various functionalities, like parsing JSON, parsing CSV, finding corresponding deer labels, etc.

There is also the megadetector folder, which has the original [Microsoft CameraTraps repository](https://github.com/microsoft/CameraTraps) as well as some extra scripts from Vivian.
